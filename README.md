# Summarizing and Analyzing Research Papers

## Project Overview

This project focuses on **Summarizing and analyzing research** related to the **Effects of Social Media on Youth Mental Health and Sleep**. Using ChatGPT prompts, I extracted key insights from the research paper “[The Impact of Social Media Use on Sleep and Mental Health in Youth](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11920-024-01481-9)” and simplified the findings for broader understanding.

## Key Insights

- **Mental Health Impacts**: Excessive social media use contributes to **anxiety, depression, and emotional stress** in youth, often triggered by behaviors such as **cyberbullying** and the **fear of missing out (FOMO)**.
- **Sleep Disruptions**: Social media use, especially late at night, leads to **delayed bedtimes**, **shorter sleep durations**, and **insomnia**, creating a cycle that worsens mental health.

## Methodology

The research analysis was conducted using **ChatGPT-generated prompts** to:
- Summarize key findings on the correlation between social media usage and mental health issues.
- Highlight gaps in existing literature, including inconsistent methodologies and the lack of longitudinal studies.

### Tools Used
- **ChatGPT prompts** for research summarization
- **Scoping review methodology** for structured analysis
